# Genuary 2026 - Skills-Based Approach

This project uses a **Goose skill** for Genuary 2026 creative coding.

The skill is located at `.goose/skills/genuary/SKILL.md` and teaches Goose how to:
- Find and interpret daily prompts from `prompts.json`
- Pitch whimsical, delightful ideas
- Create p5.js generative art
- Verify art visually using Chrome DevTools
- Save outputs as PNG and GIF

## Quick Start
Just say "let's do genuary" and the skill takes over!

## Key Difference from Harness Approach
This version has NO shell script harness. Goose learns the workflow from the skill and figures out the tooling itself. This makes it more adaptable but relies on the skill being well-written.

## Requirements
- Chrome DevTools extension must be enabled
- Skills extension must be enabled in Goose config

## Troubleshooting

### Chrome DevTools Setup (IMPORTANT!)

This recipe uses Chrome on **port 9223**. Before using Chrome DevTools, run:
```bash
# Kill any zombie processes from previous sessions
pkill -f "chrome-devtools-mcp" 2>/dev/null || true

# Check if Chrome is already listening on port 9223
if ! lsof -i :9223 > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  # Launch Chrome with remote debugging enabled
  /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome \
    --remote-debugging-port=9223 \
    --user-data-dir=/tmp/genuary-skills-chrome \
    --no-first-run \
    --no-default-browser-check \
    &
  sleep 3
fi
```

### Chrome DevTools Errors

If you get any of these errors:
- `Protocol error (Target.setAutoAttach): Target closed`
- `Protocol error (Runtime.callFunctionOn): Target closed`
- `Protocol error (DOM.resolveNode): No node with given id found`

**Fix:** Make sure Chrome is running with remote debugging on port 9223 (see above).

**Why this happens:** The MCP server connects to Chrome via `--browserUrl http://127.0.0.1:9223`. If Chrome isn't running with that debugging port, connections fail.

### Rate Limiting

If you hit a rate limit from the LLM provider:
1. Tell the user: "Hit rate limit, waiting 30-60 seconds..."
2. Wait: `sleep 30`
3. Retry the operation
4. **Don't just stop** — the user will think you failed

### Page Shows Blank in Chrome

1. Check if index.html has content: `cat days/dayXX/index.html | head -20`
2. Check for JavaScript errors: use `chromedevtools__list_console_messages`
3. Verify p5.js is loading (check network tab or script tags)

### Parallel Sessions

**This recipe uses port 9223.** The main genuary recipe uses port 9222.

Both can run simultaneously because they connect to different Chrome instances:
- genuary: `--remote-debugging-port=9222` → `/tmp/genuary-chrome`
- genuary-skills (this one): `--remote-debugging-port=9223` → `/tmp/genuary-skills-chrome`

Make sure both Chrome instances are running before starting parallel sessions.
