# 🎨 Genuary 2026

Daily generative art challenge powered by [Goose AI](https://github.com/block/goose).

> **Genuary** is an annual creative coding challenge where artists create one piece of generative art per day in January, following community prompts.

## 🪿 Made with Goose

This repo contains two experimental approaches for creating Genuary art with Goose:

| Approach | Directory | How it works |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Harness** | `genuary/` | Recipe + shell script for scaffolding |
| **Skills** | `genuary-skills/` | Recipe + Goose skill (learned knowledge) |

Both approaches:
- Find the daily prompt
- Pitch whimsical, creative ideas
- Write p5.js code
- Verify with Chrome DevTools
- Save GIF/video + PNG outputs
- Push to GitHub

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Using the Harness Approach
```bash
# From anywhere, run:
/genuary day=3
```

### Using the Skills Approach
```bash
# First cd to the skills directory:
cd genuary-skills

# Then run:
/genuary-skills day=3
```
