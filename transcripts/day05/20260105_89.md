I'll help you with Genuary Day 5! Let me first check the skill file and the prompts to understand what we're working with.

There's already a sketch for Day 5! Let me open it in Chrome DevTools to see how it looks:

Oh WOW! 🎨 This is **DELIGHTFUL**! 

Look at this - it's an **Etch A Sketch** drawing "GENUARY" in real-time! The concept is brilliant:
- The iconic red frame with the "Etch A Sketch®" logo
- The silvery aluminum powder screen
- Those beautiful white knobs at the bottom
- The letters being drawn one stroke at a time, just like the real toy!

I can see it's currently animating - it's drawn "GE" and is working on the "N". Let me wait a moment and take another screenshot to see the full word:

The screen went black! It looks like the page may have navigated away or there's an issue. Let me reload it:

It's animating! Now I can see "GENI" being drawn. Let me wait for the full word to complete:

**BEAUTIFUL!** 🎉 The full word "GENUARY" is now complete!

This is an **absolutely delightful** interpretation of Day 5's prompt "Write Genuary - Avoid using a font":

## What makes this extraordinary:

1. **The Concept** - Using an Etch A Sketch is GENIUS! It's:
   - Nostalgic and instantly recognizable
   - Perfectly fits "no fonts" since it draws with a continuous line
   - Has that authentic hand-drawn wobble

2. **The Details** - Look at this craftsmanship:
   - The iconic red plastic frame with 3D shading
   - "Etch A Sketch®" logo embossed at the top
   - The silvery aluminum powder screen texture
   - Those gorgeous white knobs with ridged grips
   - The deep recessed bezel around the screen

3. **The Animation** - It draws letter by letter, stroke by stroke, just like the real toy!

4. **Interactive Features** (from the code):
   - Click to shake and erase!
   - Press 'R' to restart
   - Press 'S' to save

Let me check if there are any outputs saved yet:

The Chrome DevTools extension seems to be having connection issues. Let me try a different approach - I'll use a shell command to take a screenshot:

The Day 5 work exists but hasn't been committed yet. Let me try to get Chrome working again to save the output:
