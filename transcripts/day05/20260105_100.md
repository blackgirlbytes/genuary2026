/genuary-skills day=5 get the output , images, code etc and push it to github..make sure it's also accessible from the landing page for the site..so that I can go to the Skills tab and see the preview. look at how the rest of the code is set up

## ASSISTANT

I'll help you with Genuary Day 5! Let me first check the skill file and understand the project structure, then create the artwork.

Day 5 already exists! Let me check the current code and see what's there, then view it in the browser to capture the output.

The output folder is empty. Let me check how other days are set up to understand the structure, then view the Day 5 artwork and capture the outputs.

Let me check if there's a landing page/site structure to understand how the Skills tab works:

Now I understand the structure. The landing page at `index.html` has a `availableDays` object that needs to be updated to include Day 5 for the `genuary-skills` version. Let me:

1. Open the Day 5 artwork in the browser to view and capture it
2. Save the PNG output
3. Update the landing page
4. Push to GitHub

This is fantastic! The Etch A Sketch concept is brilliant - it's drawing "GENUARY" without using a font, perfectly matching the prompt. I can see it's animating and currently shows "GENU," with more letters being drawn. Let me wait for the animation to complete and then capture the full result.

The text is drawn on canvas, so let me just wait a few seconds and take another screenshot to capture the completed drawing:

The full "GENUARY" is now drawn on the Etch A Sketch! This is a delightful piece - the nostalgic red Etch A Sketch with realistic knobs, the "Etch A Sketch®" logo, and the hand-drawn letters perfectly capture the prompt "Write Genuary - Avoid using a font."

Now let me capture the canvas as a PNG and save it to the output folder:
