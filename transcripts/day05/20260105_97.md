/genuary-skills day=5 this exists and the animation is perfect..I dont want to change that..but I want the etch a sketch toy itself to be more hyper realistic..like the knobs..the words etch a sketch..the creen

## ASSISTANT

I'll take a look at the current Day 5 sketch and enhance the etch-a-sketch toy's realism while preserving the animation. Let me first see what we're working with.

I can see the current Etch A Sketch! The animation is drawing "GENUARY" nicely. Now I need to make the toy itself hyper-realistic. Let me scroll down to see the knobs better:

I can see the full Etch A Sketch now. The animation is great! Now I'll enhance the realism of:

1. **The knobs** - make them look like real white plastic with more depth, ridges, and realistic lighting
2. **The "Etch A Sketch" logo** - make it look properly embossed/raised like the real toy
3. **The screen** - add more realistic glass/plastic feel
4. **The frame** - add more realistic plastic texture and molding details

Let me create a hyper-realistic version:

Looking good! The knobs look much more realistic now with proper depth and shading. Let me scroll up to see the logo and the full frame:

Excellent! This is looking much more hyper-realistic now! I can see:

✅ **Corner screws** - Nice Phillips head screws in the corners
✅ **Better frame gradient** - The red plastic has a realistic 3D gradient (lighter at top, darker at bottom)
✅ **Improved screen bezel** - Metallic frame around the screen with proper depth
✅ **Better "Etch A Sketch" logo** - More embossed/raised appearance
✅ **Realistic knobs** - Much better with proper depth, knurled edges, and lighting

Let me make a few more refinements to make it even more hyper-realistic - the logo could use a bit more work to look like proper raised plastic lettering, and I want to add some subtle details:
