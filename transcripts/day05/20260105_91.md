/genuary day=5 this exists but i need the fireflies to form the word genuary a little faster..so people can get a dopamine hit faster..not too fast where it's uncomfortable and chaotic but we want the right amount of satisfaction

## ASSISTANT

I'll check out the current day 5 sketch and see how the fireflies are forming "GENUARY", then speed it up for that perfect dopamine timing.

Now let me see it in action to understand the current timing:

Let me try starting a fresh browser session:

I can see the fireflies are still in the jar at the start. Looking at the code, I can identify the key timing parameters that control how fast the word forms:

**Current timing bottlenecks:**
1. `releaseDelay = 90 + fireflyIndex * 45` - First firefly waits 90 frames (~1.5s), then each subsequent one waits 45 more frames (~0.75s each)
2. `wanderDuration = random(400, 800)` - Fireflies wander for 400-800 frames (6-13 seconds!) before settling
3. `pullStrength` in settling phase is very gentle (0.003 to 0.015)

For that satisfying dopamine hit, I'll:
- Speed up the release (shorter delays between fireflies)
- Reduce wandering time significantly
- Make settling more purposeful but still organic

Now let me speed up the wandering duration and make the settling phase snappier:

Now let me make the settling phase more satisfying - stronger pull but still organic:

Also let me speed up the rising phase slightly so they get out of the jar faster:

Hmm, the page looks dark - let me check if there's an issue and wait a moment for it to load properly:

Still dark - let me check the page snapshot to see what's happening:

The page is blank. Let me navigate directly to the file:

The fireflies are already escaping! I can see them rising from the jar. Let me wait a few seconds and take another screenshot to see them forming the word:

The fireflies are escaping much faster now! I can see them streaming out of the jar and rising up. Let me wait a few more seconds to see them form "GENUARY":

Looking good! The fireflies are streaming out much faster now. Let me take a few more screenshots over time to see the full reveal:
