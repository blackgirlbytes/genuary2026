/genuary day=5 but i think the fireflies move fast in a weird way..and they dont really spell out genuary..or it's hard to see..maybe the blobs should be smaller..they can come out the jar..slowly fly around..and just eventually form the letters before you even know it..it should look natural..how fireflies typically fly

## ASSISTANT

You're right! Let me look at the current implementation and then fix it to be more natural and magical.

Now let me see it in action to understand the current behavior:

I see the issues! The fireflies are:
1. Too big/blobby
2. Moving in a weird, mechanical way
3. Already scattered - not coming from the jar naturally
4. The letters aren't readable

Let me completely rewrite this with **natural firefly behavior**:
- Smaller, more delicate fireflies
- Realistic flight patterns (gentle curves, pauses, hovering)
- Start in the jar, slowly drift out one by one
- Wander freely, then *gradually* drift toward their letter positions
- The word should emerge organically over time

The page looks very dark - let me scroll down to see the canvas and check if there's an issue:

Something's wrong - the page is completely black. Let me check for JavaScript errors:

The page navigated to about:blank. Let me reload properly:

I can see the scene now - there's the night sky with moon and stars, and I can see a firefly starting to emerge at the bottom. The jar is there but I need to scroll down to see it better. Let me wait a moment and take another screenshot to see the fireflies in action:

The fireflies are emerging and moving more naturally now! They're smaller and have a nicer glow. I can see them drifting upward from the jar area. Let me wait longer to see them settle into the letters:

Let me wait for the animation to progress and then take a screenshot:

Now I can see the jar with fireflies inside, and some have started escaping and floating upward! The movement looks much more natural. But I notice:

1. The fireflies are still a bit too big/blobby
2. They're bunched together in the jar - need more space
3. The release is happening but let me wait longer to see if they form letters

Let me wait more and check the final result:
