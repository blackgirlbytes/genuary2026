# Genuary Day 4: Pixels! 🎨

Love the half-and-half concept! Here's my idea:

**Concept: "Digital Decay"**
An image that smoothly transitions from crisp/detailed on one side to heavily pixelated on the other - like watching reality dissolve into digital abstraction. We could do:

1. **Diagonal split** - pixelation increases from one corner to the opposite
2. **Radial** - center is clear, edges get pixelated (or vice versa)
3. **Horizontal/Vertical gradient** - classic left-to-right transition

I'm thinking we could use a generative pattern (maybe flowing shapes, circles, or an interesting geometric design) where the pixelation level varies across the canvas.

Let me set this up:
